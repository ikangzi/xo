    Privacy Policy for ikang.netlify.app
  </h1>
  
  <h2>
    Last updated:  [10 December 2025]
  </h2>
 
    Welcome to ikang.netlify.app. Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy describes what data I collect (if any), how I use it, and what choices you have.

  <br>
  
  <h3>
    1. Who I Am
  </h3>
The website is hosted at ikang.netlify.app. The site shares information about my personal journey — music, pictures, projects, poems — and serves as a portfolio / personal blog for me.

  <h3>
    2. Information I Collect
  </h3>
I do not automatically collect personal information from visitors.
The only time personal data may be collected is when a visitor voluntarily contacts me (e.g. by email). In that case, I may learn their name, email address, and any other contact details they provide.

  
  <h3>
    3. Use of Cookies / Hosting Service Notes
  </h3>
I currently do not run any tracking tools (like analytics) on the website.
Because the site is hosted on Netlify (netlify.app), there may be cookies or related mechanisms used by Netlify itself for hosting infrastructure (for site functionality, security, performance, etc.). According to Netlify’s policy, Netlify uses “cookies and similar technologies” to provide services, secure content delivery, and maintain a safe hosting environment. 
I do not use those cookies to track your personal behavior or build profiles; they are only used as needed by the hosting platform.


  <h3>
    4. Third-Party Services
  </h3>
I use Netlify for hosting.
For contact / email (if you reach out), the contact email is provided via Tuta.io.
I do not share your contact details with any third-party services (unless required for communication with you).

  
  <h3>
    5. Payments
  </h3>
My website does not offer any paid services, and I do not accept any payments.

  
  <h3>
    6. Children / Audience
  </h3>
The website is open to everyone. I do not specifically target children under 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

  
  <h3>
   7. How I Use Contact Information
  </h3>
If you contact me via email or other means, I may use the information you provide (like name and email) only to respond to your message. I will not store it longer than necessary, or use it for any other purpose, unless I ask for your consent.

  
  <h3>
    8. Your Rights & Control
  </h3>
Since I do not automatically collect personal data or track you, you don’t need to take any action to protect your privacy here.
If you contacted me and provided personal data, you can request deletion or that I stop using it — just reach out to me at
            <strong>info.ikang@proton.me</strong>            

  
  <h3>
    9. Contact for Privacy Concerns
  </h3>
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your privacy or this policy, please contact me at 
            <strong>info.ikang@proton.me</strong>

  
  <h3>
    10. Policy Changes
  </h3>
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (e.g. if I add new features or third-party tools). I will reflect the updates here. By using or visiting ikang.netlify.app, you agree to the terms in this policy.
